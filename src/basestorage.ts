/**
 * Defines options used by the storage classes to determine how they will interact. This will be injected into any Storage classes
 * created with or after creation of the options. Here is the most common usage of StorageOptions:
 * ```typescript
 * import {Component} from "angular2/core";
 * import {ConfigureStorage} from "h5webstorage/api";
 * 
 * @Component({
 * 	providers:[ConfigureStorage({ prefix: '/'})]
 * })
 * export class RootApp{}
 * ```
 * 
 * {@link ConfigureStorage} creates a provider for your configuration options which is injected into the next Storage class instantiated.
 * Since these options were added to the 'RootApp', it will apply globally and all {@link LocalStorage} and {@link SessionStorage} will
 * have these options injected unless overridden by a new set of options.
 * 
 * Remember, {@link https://angular.io angular2} has an injection heirarchy and multiple providers for one type can be created. Lets explore
 * how this might work. Using our example above, the prefix '/' is used on all keys for the entire application. This is so some rouge 
 * application won't polute the keyspace of your app. Let's also assume we have created a wrapper around the `LocalStorage` object to apply
 * business logic to the data and a subset of the keys needs to be read-only admin stuff. How can we set the values if the wrapper of those
 * values are read-only? Here is how I would solve this problem:
 * ```typescript
 * import {Component} from "angular2/core";
 * import {LocalStorage, LOCAL_STORAGE_PROVIDER, ConfigureStorage} from "h5webstorage/api";
 * import {AppSettings} from "./myApp.settings";
 * @Component({
 * 	providers: [LOCAL_STORAGE_PROVIDER, ConfigureStorage({ prefix: '/admin/'})]
 * })
 * export class AdminPanel{
 * 	constructor(localStorage: LocalStorage, settings: AppSettings){ ... }
 * }
 * ``` 
 * Let me explain what just happened, AdminPanel is a component under RootApp. AppSettings is the global application setting that handles
 * business logic for the storage which has the read-only admin area. AppSettings can see all the application keys that begin with '/' so 
 * that includes '/admin/'. AdminPanel takes advantage of the injection heirarcy in angular2 by asking for a new instance of `LocalStorage`.
 * If we stopped there, it would work the exact same way as the `LocalStorage` in AppSettings which is why there is a new `ConfigureStorage`
 * call in the providers array also. This will tell angular2 to inject these new options into the new `LocalStorage` instance which will be
 * scoped to only the '/admin/' keys. `LocalStorage` has no restrictions on which keys it can modify within its scope. Creating, updating,
 * modifying or deleting a key in `LocalStorage` within AdminPanel will reflect immediately in the AppSettings instance.
